# Hi, I'm Liam! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Computer Science and Physics Combined Major @ UBC, who builds a cool project here and there :)

Currently writing software for Neuralink's laser-micromachining robot, on the surgical robotics software team!

You may know me from:
- [Crumb](https://github.com/liam-ilan/crumb), a high level, functional, interpreted, dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language, with a terse syntax, and a verbose standard library.
- [gpt-rs](https://github.com/UBCFormulaElectric), a Rust implementation of a causal decoder transformer and BPE tokenizer.
- [Terminal3d](https://github.com/liam-ilan/terminal3d), a tool to render 3d models directly in the terminal.
- [The Periodic Table of Orbitals](https://liam-ilan.github.io/electron-orbitals/), an educational resource that helps you browse and visualize electron orbitals. 
- [Visualizing the Impossible](https://liam-ilan.github.io/time-dependent-schrodinger-equation/), an article about how to simulate and visualize the smallest particles in our universe.
- And many more...
